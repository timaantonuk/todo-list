# Task management application 


I have developed a task management application that offers users the capability to generate tasks and subsequently remove them as needed. Additionally, I have implemented sophisticated searching and filtering algorithms, along with a theme switcher feature. Fully adaptive for mobile devices, PC and tablet. Notably, all user data is meticulously preserved through utilization of local storage mechanisms. For a comprehensive experience, please access the application via the following link: [Todo List Application](https://todo-list-beta-rust.vercel.app/)
